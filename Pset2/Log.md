# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with Apurv and ULA's.
# Discussion
The actual function making was very chill and didn't take much work. However, the hardest part for me was figuring out how to read in my command line arguments and edge casing. For example, I had to check if Time_steps and Game_size had were integers and took some time thinking of a solution to that. As well as I had to understand how to read in a string and overall make sure that my edge casing around the string that could be read in was working. However, the hardest part for me was dertiming how to print out my values I dertimined. I intitally would manually calculate the number of spaces after the phrase, however that system would break after 10 timesteps, 100 timesteps and 1000 timesteps. However, after going to officehours, I was able to figure out the solution to this problem!
