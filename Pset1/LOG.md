I've only coded in python and racket before, so adjusting to the syntax in c was very difficult. I had to spend a lot of time debugging for simple errors like forgetting to put a semicolon. Additionally, considering the edge cases was something new for me. In CS201, we didn't have to do much edge case checking. It was mostly about rote coding based on clearly defined base code. I really enjoy learning how to build a program from scratch and seeing the final outputs.
The ULA"s were very helpful and they taught me how to make a Makefile and the basic syntax of c. This pset didn't require any collaboration, but hopefully future psets will lead to collaboration. I enjoy talking over CS problems with friends and just having a good time in that sense. Overall, I think thinking about the edge cases was the hardest part rather than the actual coding part of the assignment.
