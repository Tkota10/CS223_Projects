# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with Linden, Apurv and ULA's.
# Discussion
The actual function making was very chill and didn't take much work. However, the hardest part was testing my functions and my memory management. Oftentimes, my function would coincide with some part of the test case, but then not coincide with other part of the test case. This led me to having to spend a lot of time analyzing really deeply into what my function was doing and also what the Main.cpp file was doing. Overall, the practice of making my own unit tests, helped me really understand my program.
