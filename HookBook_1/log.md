# Actual time to complete assignment
| Date | Time Started | Time Spent | Work completed |
| :--: | -----------: | ---------: | :------------- |
| 2/24 |      7:25 P.M. |       1:00 | read assignment, mapped out potential implementation of solutions, and theorized possible edge cases|
| 2/26 |   1:00   P.M. |       3:00 | Wrote all the major functions in my implementation and tested them each individually |
| 3/02 |       3:00 pm |       2:00 | Went through the test cases, learned about valgrind, and patched all my memory leakage  |
| 03/11 |      4:00 pm |       1:00 | Made sure my implementation met the style guide requirements and created my log file.

# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with Apurv and ULA's.
# Discussion
The actual function making was very chill and didn't take much work. However, the hardest part was testing my functions and my memory management. Oftentimes, my function would work with some test cases, but not work with others. This led me to having to spend a lot of time analyzing really deeply into what my function was doing. Additionally, I've never used valgrind before so understanding how to read in Valgrind errors took some time and trial and error.
